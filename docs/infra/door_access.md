# Door access
## Register a new user

1. create a new user on the UDM Pro and put the new user in the Hackerspace Members group
2. click the button to register an NFC tag, and swipe it on the correct reader when the system tells you to do. This can be done either locally (gateway IP) or through the remote control panel [https://unifi.ui.com](https://unifi.ui.com). Data is stored locally, and it doesn't need internet or a cloud service to work.

It's fail open for fire safety because we do not have any other way to exit.
