## Bambulab mini

This printer is property of mateo and miker, but free to use if you know
what you're doing (if not, ask help).

The printer is configured in LAN-only mode, and can be accessed on the network
via OrcaSlicer software. Install the proprietary network plugin, click on
Device, click on add printer. Don't choose "Add with PIN code" and instead go to "Other Devices" and select the "hackerspace bamboo mini". 

After that it asks for a 8 digit PIN that you can find in ``Settings > Lan Only Mode``.
