# CNC Machine

The space has a 3 axis CNC machine based on the High-Z S-720 from [CNC-STEP](https://www.cnc-step.com/high-z-s-720-cnc-router-720-x-420-x-110-mm-trapezium-screws/). To use the machine either 1T, Elvis, Teus or Sander should be present. 

## Safety
The machine has two E-stops (emergency stops). One is located on the x-axis gantry and another one on the controller electronics box. When pressed they cut the voltage to the spindle, motors and controller board. ``TODO: FACT CHECK``. 

When operating the machine:
- Don't go near the moving axis or spindle
- Always Wear earprotection
- Don't leave it unattended
- Stay attentive and be ready to hit the e-stop
